# DocumentCollection sync checks are throwing up some errors as follow:
# "documents shouldn't contain 'uuid'"
# Searching for these documents by uuid reveals a document in a strange state:
# The document will have only 1 edition and that edition state will be superseded
#
# To fix this we are going to manually set the state to `published` and then
# send them throuh the EditionUnpublisher to unpublish them with a PublishedInError
# id and reason. We have to first set the state to `published` because Edition
# workflow only allows certain state transitions.
#
# We also send them through the PublishingApi to resync data in the content store
