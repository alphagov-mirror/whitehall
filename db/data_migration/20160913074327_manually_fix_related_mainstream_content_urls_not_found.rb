# Fix mainstream and additional mainstream urls identified as being not found
# by our previous migration (remove_chapters_from_related_mainstream_urls)
# The idea is to create a hash which has the old, unfound url as the key
# and the new url as the value, then iterate through the hash and do the
# update.
# It ignores editions with a state of 'superseded'.
# This script might need to be updated depending on how much the data has
# changed between testing and deploying.

# This does the update - field_name should either be
# :related_mainstream_content_url or
# :additional_related_mainstream_content_url
# depending on which field is to be updated
