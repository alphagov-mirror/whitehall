whitehall is a Ruby on Rails content management application for content published by government departments and agencies.

## Nomenclature

- *Govspeak* A variation of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) used throughout whitehall as the general publishing format

## Technical documentation

whitehall is a Ruby on Rails app built on a MySQL database. It is deployed in two modes: 'admin' for publishers to create and manage content and 'frontend' for rendering some content under https://www.gov.uk/government and https://www.gov.uk/world. whitehall also sends most content to the publishing-api and rummager.

## Dependencies
