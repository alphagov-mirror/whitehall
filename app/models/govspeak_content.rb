  # NOTE: we delay the processing of the govspeak so as to ensure that the
  # GovspeakContent record actually exists in the database. This is necessary
  # because the re-editioning process (which clones HtmlAttachments, and thus
  # GovspeakContent) takes a while, meaning the transaction may not have
  # completed before the job is picked up, causing ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
  # errors.
